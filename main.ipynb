    "Our 'best' neighborhood is being calculated by the safety of the neighborhood. This is determined by data such as fire incidents, arrests, fire arm seizures, and police incidents. Each neighborhood is given a percent score based on the number of occurences in that neighborhood, and then the overall percent is multiplied by a weight based on the importance of that dataset. There are also negative scores for data such as hospitals. The 'best' neighborhood will have the lowest score."
